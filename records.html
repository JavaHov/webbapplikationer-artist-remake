                <b>The Buddha of Suburbia</b> is a 1993 soundtrack album by English singer-songwriter David Bowie inspired by the four-part television serial of the same name originally shown on BBC2 (itself adapted from the novel of the same name by Hanif Kureishi). Although classified as a 'soundtrack album', the title track is the only song that featured in the programme's actual soundtrack.

                <b>Heathen</b> (stylised as uǝɥʇɐǝɥ) is the 22nd studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 11 June 2002 on his ISO Records label, in conjunction with Columbia Records. Although its production had started before the September 11 attacks in 2001, the album was finished after that date, which resulted in the influencing of its concept.[1][14][15] It was considered a comeback for him in the US market by becoming his highest charting album (number 14) since Tonight (1984).
